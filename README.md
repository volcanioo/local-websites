# The local website database
We are living in different countries with different languages, but around the world, every state has at least one local websites for;

* Find an Apartment
* Order Food
* Buy/Sell Car
* Buy/Sell House
* Buy/Sell Second-hand Furniture

The local website database will help you to find specific websites for your country.

# What We Have
We currently support 3 different countries;

* Turkey `100%`
* Germany `35%`

> We still need more Germany and Brasil websites! If you need more detail about the list/categories let me know!
